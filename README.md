#HXConf-2016: Technical debt

Slides for my talk presented at Holiday Extras 2016 web conference.
The focus is around the process of identifying technical debt, to raising awareness and how we commit to fixing the debt

## How to get it running

I used [remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark) to generate the slides.
You can view the slides offline by opening [index.html](/index.html).

I was using [live-server](https://github.com/tapio/live-server) to run and watch for changes during writing the talk (while also allowing me to ad hoc changes mid talk if needed).
To use live-server, you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and then:

```
1. npm install
2. npm start
```

It should then open up your browser under `localhost:8080`.
