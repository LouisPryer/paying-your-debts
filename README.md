# HXConf-2016: Paying your debts

Slides for my talk on Technical Debt presented at Holiday Extras 2016 web conference.
The focus is around the process of identifying technical debt, to raising awareness and how we commit to fixing the debt.

## How to get it running

I used [remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark) to generate the slides.
You can view the slides offline by opening [index.html](/index.html).

I was using [live-server](https://github.com/tapio/live-server) to run and watch for changes during writing the talk (while also allowing me to ad hoc changes mid talk if needed).
To use live-server, you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and then:

```
1. npm install
2. npm start
```

It should then open up your browser under `localhost:8080`.

## Abstract

So you think you found some technical debt, where do we go from here?
This talk I will discuss some tips I use in the process of identifying technical debt, raising awareness of the debt along with it's impact to non technical memebers or the team and how we can action it to pay off.
